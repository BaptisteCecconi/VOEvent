# VOEvent Sky Event Reporting Metadata

## What is it?

VOEvent: **V**irtual **O**bservatory **Event** Sky Event Reporting Metadata 

VOEvent defines the content and meaning of a standard information packet for 
representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a 
transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of 
interest. The objective is to motivate the observation of targets-of-opportunity, 
to drive robotic telescopes, to trigger archive searches, and to alert the 
community. VOEvent is focused on the reporting of photon events, but events 
mediated by disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and 
solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported.

## Status?

The last stable version is
**[REC-2.0](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOEvent/)**.

The next version is prepared in this repository. 
_It is not yet finalized and so, should not be considered
yet as stable for operational implementation._

[Releases](https://github.com/ivoa-std/VOEvent/releases) of this GitHub Repository.
